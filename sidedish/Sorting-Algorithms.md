# Sorting Algorithms
![](img/Sorting+Algorithm.svg)


## Selection Sort
- Running time is insensitive to input
- Data movement is minimal (compare with bubble sort): the number of array access is a linear function of the array size
- Unstable


## Priority Queue & Heapsort

## Insertion Sort => inserting elements
- Running time depends on the initial order of items in the input
- Efficient for partially sorted arrays
- Fine method for tiny arrays
- Stable

## Shellsort
- A simple extension of insertion sort  
  - allowing exchanges of array entries that are far apart :arrow_right: produce partially sorted array :arrow_right: do insertion sort :arrow_right: gain speed
- Increment sequence
- Performs well on arrays in arbitrary order
- Useful for large arrays
- Unstable

## Bubble Sort

### Cocktail Shaker Sort

## Quicksort



## Merge Sort
- Top-down mergesort
- Bottom-up mergesort

## Counting Sort

## Bucket Sort => double type

## Radix Sort => string sorts (LSD, MSD)


- In-place: transforms input using no auxiliary data structure  
冒泡排序、选择排序、插入排序、归并排序、快速排序、希尔排序、堆排序  

- Out-of-place: needs extra space to put the elements in as it's sorting them  
计数排序、桶排序、基数排序
